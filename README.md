## One Mega Problem Statement - "Setting Up of a Car Company"

All 23 Gang of four Design Patterns implemented in Java

### _Whats So SPECIAL_ :

When I was preparing for interview, I could not find a single problem statement that will use all the design patterns. So, To revise all the design patterns in one go, I can just look at that one big problem statement and i'll be good to go.

So, I set out to create that Mega Problem and came up with "Setting Up of a Car Company".

All the patterns are implemented using one Mega problem statement i.e Setting up of a Car Company Which involves creating a Car factory in a city that has different models of cars; have showrooms in different cities; Headquarter somewhere; car manufacturing process and Hierarchy of Employee that has different job within the car company.

Following are the features in our problem statement :

### Behavioral Design Patterns -

#### 1. CHAIN OF RESPONSIBILITY -

In our new Car Artificial Intelligence software, there is a possibility of virus from other hackers.There are different levels of virus and based on that level, employees can solve or not solve it. So, we have a team of developers and there is a hierarchy of developers. So, when there is a virus found in the system, it is given to the engineer. If he can not solve it, then he will pass it to team lead; if team lead cant then he will pass it to technical officer;etc. .

#### 2. COMMAND -

In our new Car, We want to provide user a remote with only one button ( Just for elegance ) that can be used to perform differnt tasks like lighton , play music and Controlling Air condition etc. All these commands can be performed on a single button press;

#### 3. INTERPRETER -

In our car, We want to create a voice command system in which commands can be created and interpreted. e.g startcar, fuelcheck, autodrive etc. for these commands there are AND OR combination of commands like fuelcheck and doorclosed.

#### 4. ITERATOR -

In our company, we want to maintain a list of customers and cars and we want to iterate through these lists and get the details.
